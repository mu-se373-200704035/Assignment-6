# Assignment-6

In this assignment firstly I created a database and a table for users. The php code was already provided so the aim was to get the client to successfully register and login. 

I created 2 pages for login and register. The homepage is already created automatically with a blank project. I haven't paid attention to styling this one because that was not the point.

Some screenshots are added below:

![register]("/src/img/ss1")

![login]("/src/img/ss2")

![home]("/src/img/ss3")
